#step1:print angles from 9:00 to 9:55(if  angles exceeds 360 use mod) 
#step2:print angles from 10:00 to 10:55
#step3:print angles from 11:00 to 11:55
#step4:write a for loop for steps 1 2 3
#step5:change range to print from 9:00 to 8:55
#step6:save file as 21.py

#step7:print time as 9:00,9:05,9:10
#step8:write forloop to print 9:00 to 9:55
#step9:repeat step8 for 10:00 to 10:55
#step10:repeat step8 for 11:00 to 11:55
#step11:write for loop to print time from 9:00 to 11:55
#step12:change range to from 9:00 to 8:55

#step13:combine both into a single file to print time-angle example 9:00 - 90,9:05 - 117.5
